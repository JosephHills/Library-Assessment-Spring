Why are we doing this?

In order to evidence our understanding of a complete, working API front end and back end.

How I expected the challenge to go.

I had hoped to finish it in it's entirety!

What went well?

I fully understand everything I have done so far aside from the last two days. The back end part I have managed to fully comprehend at this point.

What didn't go as planned?

I unfortunateley strugled with the later stages due to missing two days last week before the project.
I ran out of time as I had spend too long trying to catch up on the missed sessions.


Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.

Better time management, and fewer missed sessions hopefully!
